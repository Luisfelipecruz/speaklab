"""Fluency from word timings: how fast, how broken up, how hesitant.

Everything here is arithmetic over `turns.words`. No model reads a transcript to decide
whether somebody sounded fluent — the same recording produces the same six numbers on
every rebuild, which is what makes them safe to plot over months.

**Speech rate and articulation rate are kept apart deliberately.** A speaker who gets
faster only by pausing less has not learned to articulate any faster, and one number
covering both reports that as progress. Speech rate spends the pauses; articulation rate
removes them. Both are words per minute so they can be read against each other.

**One definition of a pause, used by three metrics.** A gap of at least
`FLUENCY_PAUSE_MS` between the end of one word and the start of the next. Every gap
smaller than that is treated as continuous speech, because word boundaries from the
recogniser are only accurate to a few tens of milliseconds and summing every small gap
would mostly measure its timestamp granularity. Articulation rate, pause ratio and mean
length of run all use this one rule, so they cannot disagree about what a pause is.

**The span, not the file.** Duration runs from the start of the first word to the end of
the last. Leading and trailing silence is the recorder — somebody reaching for a button —
and counting it as pausing would make a speaker look hesitant for being slow with a
mouse. The leading silence is kept separately, and named for what it is.

**Filler counting undercounts, twice over, and both are worth knowing.** The recogniser
is trained on cleaned transcripts and drops most `um`s before this code ever sees them;
and bare `like` is not counted at all, because "like a dog or a cat" is an ordinary
preposition and no rule over a word list can tell it from the discourse marker. So this
number is a floor. It moves when somebody is dysfluent enough to survive the recogniser,
and it is never evidence that a speaker had no fillers.
